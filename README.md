# Code katas

Repo with some coding katas that I completed, some challenges to refresh my knowledge or to explore other programming languages (ie. Rust, Go, Reason...). I used to do some katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/ftorrado/completed_solutions), but have been enjoying the discussions on [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) or doing exercises with bigger scope more lately.
